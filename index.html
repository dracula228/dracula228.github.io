<p>General information about Burundi; </p>

<p>The little country of Burundi is organized South of the Equator in the Great Lakes area. Lake Tanganyika is the most significant on earth, second just to Baikal Lake in Siberia. It has a region of in excess of 673 km with an ordinary width of 50 km. The scene is directed by mountains and water. </p>

<p>The inclines around the Big Lakes are among the most thickly populated areas, considering the way that vulcanic practices have made a productive soil. The great nations furthermore have a smooth climate, paying little mind to the district of the Equator. As such the region is outside the zone where the tsetse-fly has its home, so dairy steers can without quite a bit of a stretch be kept. The country has a tropical air, constrained by rises and seasons. Multiple times each year there is a dry and a wet season. The ordinary temperature, dependent upon the height, is some place in the scope of 17 and 24 degrees. The scene has a lot to offer; green inclines and huge Lake Tanganyika both having their own one of a kind verdure. </p>

<p>The lake offers the potential – not yet recognized – of watersports and fun. The whole coastline from Bujumbura to Lake Nyanza used to be grouped "the Burundese Rivièra" by an enthusiastic position. Burundi has 2 national parks; in the North West the Kibira Nationa Park with its high rainforest which enters the Nyungwe Park in Rwanda, and the Rurubu National Park in the North East along the Ruruburiver. </p>
